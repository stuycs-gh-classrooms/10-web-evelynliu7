      TXT is another boy group under HYBE. They consist of 5 members and debutted in 2019. Their song "Ghosting" is about being cut off from
      the rest of the world, but the melody is not as melancholy as you would expect from the lyrics. The constrast makes the song a lot more
      interesting and the instrumentals are also very calming.

      ALthough released 9 years ago, "War-r-r" still remains a popular song today. The lyrics are about being lost in a relationship and feeling
      a little helpless. As Colde sings in a soft tone, the beats in the background bring the listener's attention in, making the song enjoyable to
      listen to.
