    <h1> Fractal Modifications! </h1>
    <h2> Koch Curve </h2>
      <p> This is the basic Koch Curve original_koch_curve(t, 4, 20) </p>
      <p> <img src=" "> </p>
      <p> My Koch Curve will change the turtle's color to a random pinkish
          color everytime it moves forward and the angles are now 30 and 150
          instead of 60 and 120. Here's what it looks like:

    <h2> Sierpinski Triangle </h2>
      <p> This is the basic Sierpinski Triangle original_draw_sierpinski(t, 5, 200) </p>
      <p> <img src=" "> </p>
      <p> My Sierpinski will change the turtle's pen color to a random pinkish
          color everytime it draws a new triangle and fills the triangle with
          that color. Additionally, with every recursive call, it will draw another
          Sierpinski Triangle of the previous depth (rotated 60 degress to the left)
          inside the previously empty triangle. Here's the results:

    <h2> Tree </h2>
      <p> This is the basic Tree original_tree(t, 4, 50, 20) </p>
      <p> <img src=" "> </p>
      <p> My Tree will change the turtle's color to a random pinkish
          color everytime it moves forward and the the width and length 
          decrease with every level of the tree. The angle is also randomized.
          Here's what my tree displays:
