      <h1> MAGO by GFRIEND </h1>
      <p class="description">
        The message of the song "MAGO" is to embrance your own desires and express them without fear. The girls' refreshing and soft voices combine really well
        with track's retro instrumentals to create an upbeat song. It's perfecting for dancing and vibing to, and the bright sparkles in the MV add a nice touch.

      <h1> Feel Special by TWICE </h1>
      <p class="description">
        The concept of this song is very elegant as the group sings about how someone makes them feel special just by being there for them. It was more specifically
        about how the rest of TWICE helped their member Sana when she was going through a rough time.

      <h1> Spicy by aespa </h1>
      <p class="description">
        "Spicy" is a very assertive song. It emphasizes confidence, individuality, and energy, where the lyrics are about how the members are unattainable and confident
        in their unique qualities. This is emphasized through the energetic beats and dynamic bass sounds in the track.

      <h1> Some by BOL4 </h1>
      <p class="description">
        "Some" describes the feeling of a teenage girl when she has a crush. She wants a loving relationship and just wants to be honest about how she feels. She plans
        to hang out with him and prepares her confession. Overall, it's a very cute concept and the song itself sounds very sweet and will automatically make
        you smile.
