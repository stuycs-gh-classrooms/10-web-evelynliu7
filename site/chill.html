      <h1> Bills by ENHYPEN </h1>
      <p class="description">
        This track describes the emotions after a breakup and the price one pays for letting their loved one go. Although that description may describe a
        ballad, "Bills" is very refreshing and easy to listen to. The catchy beats combined with the members' relaxing voices makes this song sound lighthearted
        and chill.

      <h1> Left Right by XG </h1>
      <p class="description">
        The main theme of the song "Left Right" is to trust yourself. The beats in the background compliment the artists' dreamy voices really well. It's the
        perfect song to dance to and is not too loud or too quiet. The other song in this album is "Shooting Star", which is another upbeat and similar song!

      <h1> We Lost the Summer by TXT </h1>
      <p class="description">
        "We Lost the Summer" describes the loss of old daily routines teenagers had before the Coronavirus pandemic. Everyone was faced with a different world
        and they started realizing the things they took for granted. This track combines an upbeat instrumental with memorable melodies that make is sound
        just as nostalgic as the meaning behind the song. Definitely watch the MV as the visuals really represent the pandemic's situation.

      <h1> Sour Grapes by LE SSERAFIM </h1>
      <p class="description">
        This track compares love to sour grapes. Instead of being sweet and enjoyable like they expected, it's rather sour and heartbreaking. The theme is
        about avoiding love as they "don't want a taste" of the sour grapes. The catchy melody and the member's soft voices will definitely make the chorus
        stuck in your head all day long!

      <h1> Ditto by NewJeans </h1>
      <p class="description">
        Ditto by NewJeans is a typical love song about falling for someone right away and trying to confess, hoping to have a pure and happy relationship. The MV
        for this also has two sides: Side A and Side B. They show two different perspectives of a girl, Ban Hee-Soo's high school life. There are many conspiracy
        theories about the meaning behind the two short films, but I'll leave that up to you to decide what to believe!
