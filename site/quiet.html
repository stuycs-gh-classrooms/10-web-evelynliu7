      <h1> War-r-r by Colde </h1>
      <p class="description">
        Although released 9 years ago, "WAR-R-R" still remains a popular song today. The lyrics are about being lost in a relationship and feeling
        a little helpless. As Colde sings in a soft tone, the beats in the background bring the listener's attention in, making the song enjoyable to
        listen to.

      <h1> Try Again by Jaehyun and d.ear </h1>
      <p class="description">
        "Try Again" is about someone who is sure of their emotions, although he is aware his relationship may end soon. The acoustics
        and slow beat makes this song perfect for cold winter days or for studying. The artist is a soloist from SM.

      <h1> love. by wave to earth </h1>
      <p class="description">
        The song "love." by wave to earth is a beautifully calming song. The lyrics revolve around love and it's ability to trasnform
        people by creating connections that allow them to personally grow. If you're looking for a song to fall asleep to, this is
        definitely the one! Wave to earth's discography overall has a similar vibe to this song, so I recommend you to take a listen!

      <h1> DIE 4 YOU by DEAN </h1>
      <p class="description">
        As depicted by the title, "DIE 4 YOU" describes DEAN's commitment to his lover and how he is willing to go to the extremes for their relationship.
        DEAN's angelic and soft voice is overlapped with minimal beats and calming instrumentals. It's a perfect song to study and fall asleep to. (I also
        really recommend his other song "instagram"!)

      <h1> fairy of shampoo by dosii </h1>
      <p class="description">
        Based on the lyrics, the song is about how a girl brings joy and comfort into the singer's life. She is comparable to a fairy, as she softly
        approaches him and brings light into his life. The shampoo could represent how she is cleansing the loneliness away from his life. "fairy of shampoo"
        is a very softly sung song and almost sounds like whispering when overlapped with the instrumentals.
