      <h1> War-r-r by Colde </h1>
      <p class="description">
        Although released 9 years ago, "WAR-R-R" still remains a popular song today. The lyrics are about being lost in a relationship and feeling
        a little helpless. As Colde sings in a soft tone, the beats in the background bring the listener's attention in, making the song enjoyable to
        listen to.

      <h1> Try Again by Jaehyun and d.ear </h1>
      <p class="description">
        "Try Again" is about someone who is sure of their emotions, although he is aware his relationship may end soon. The acoustics
        and slow beat makes this song perfect for cold winter days or for studying. The artist is a soloist from SM.
